;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.
;;

;;; Code:

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold 80000000)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by setting these early.
